### Recovering Perfectionist • Professional Paranoid

*I build things that break gracefully and scale boringly*

</div>

<br/>

```rust
fn my_approach() -> Philosophy {
    match project_phase {
        Early => "Make it work, make it right, then make it fast",
        Growth => "Measure twice, optimize once",
        Crisis => "Fix guarantees before adding servers",
    }
}
```

### What I Actually Do

🎯 **Turn uncertainty into architecture** → When "we think it scales" needs to become "we know it breaks at X"  
🚫 **Say no to complexity** → Every dependency is a future incident

### Recent Wins

```
✓ Stopped a 6-month rewrite → Data access was the bottleneck, not architecture
✓ Constrained AI hallucinations → Confidence thresholds over blind answers  
✓ Eliminated race conditions → Idempotency over horizontal scaling
✓ Optimized RAG pipeline → Capped recall, added reranking, 40% cost reduction
```

<br/>

### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held

- Distributed systems are guilty until proven innocent
- Types at compile time are free, at runtime they're expensive
- The best abstraction is the one you can debug at 3 AM
- "Just scale it" is rarely the right answer
- If it doesn't have a postmortem DB, it's not production-ready
